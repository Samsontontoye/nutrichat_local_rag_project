# nutrichat_local_rag_project
The goal of this notebook is to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline from scratch and have it run on a local GPU.  Specifically, we'd like to be able to open a PDF file, ask questions (queries) of it and have them answered by a Large Language Model (LLM).
